                <h2>What Is Electric Vehicle?</h2>

                <p>
                    An electric vehicle (EV) is a type of vehicle that is powered by electricity, using one or more electric
                     motors for propulsion. Unlike traditional internal combustion engine vehicles that rely on gasoline or diesel, electric 
                     vehicles use electrical energy stored in batteries or other energy storage devices. There are two main types of electric
                      vehicles: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).</p>
                <p>
                    1. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):<br>
                    BEVs are fully electric vehicles that run entirely on electric power.<br>
                    They are equipped with a large battery pack that stores electrical energy.<br>
                    The electric motor is the sole source of propulsion.<br>
                    BEVs need to be plugged into an external power source, such as an electric outlet or a charging station, to recharge their batteries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):<br>
                    PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and a rechargeable battery.<br>
                    They can operate on electric power alone for shorter distances and switch to the internal combustion engine for longer trips.<br>
                    PHEVs can be charged using an external power source or can rely on the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking to recharge the battery.

                <h2>Components Used For Electric Vehicles</h2>
                <p>
                    <div id="heading">1. Electric Motor:</div>
                    The electric motor is the primary source of propulsion in an EV.
                    It converts electrical energy from the battery into mechanical energy to drive the wheels.
                    There are different types of electric motors used in EVs, such as AC (alternating current) motors and DC (direct current) motors.<br>

                    <div id="heading">2. Battery Pack:</div>
                    The battery pack is a crucial component that stores electrical energy.
                    It is typically made up of numerous individual cells, and the most common type is lithium-ion batteries.
                    The capacity and energy density of the battery pack determine the range and performance of the electric vehicle.<br>

                    <div id="heading">3. Power Electronics:</div>
                    Power electronics include inverters and converters that manage the flow of electrical energy between the battery and the electric motor.
                    Inverters convert DC power from the battery to AC power for the motor, and converters manage the voltage level.<br>

                    <div id="heading">4. Charging System:</div>
                    The charging system allows the electric vehicle to be charged from an external power source.
                    It includes the charging port, charging cable, and sometimes an on-board charger that converts AC power from the grid to DC power for the battery.<br>

                    <div id="heading">5. Thermal Management System:</div>
                    EVs use a thermal management system to regulate the temperature of the battery pack and other components.
                    Maintaining an optimal temperature range is crucial for the efficiency, performance, and longevity of the battery.<br>

                    <div id="heading">6. Electric Vehicle Controller:</div>
                    The controller manages the flow of electrical energy between the battery and the electric motor.
                    It controls the speed and torque of the motor based on driver inputs and other factors.<br>

                    <div id="heading">7. Transmission (In Some Cases):</div>
                    Electric vehicles can have either a single-speed transmission or a multi-speed transmission.
                    Some electric vehicles, particularly those with high-performance or specific efficiency goals, may have a multi-speed transmission to optimize performance.<br>

                    <div id="heading">8. Regenerative Braking System:</div>
                    Regenerative braking allows the electric motor to act as a generator during braking or coasting.
                    It converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy, which is then sent to the battery for storage and reuse.<br>

                    <div id="heading">9. On-Board Charger:</div>
                    In electric vehicles that use AC charging, an on-board charger is used to convert AC power from the grid to DC power for the battery.<br>

                    <div id="heading">10. High-Voltage Wiring and Connectors:</div>
                    EVs use high-voltage wiring to transmit power between components.
                    High-quality connectors are crucial for safety and efficiency.<br>

                    <div id="heading">11. Electric Vehicle Management System (EVMS):</div>
                    The EVMS monitors and manages various aspects of the vehicle's performance, including battery health, energy usage, and overall system efficiency.<br>

                    These components work together seamlessly to provide a clean, efficient, and sustainable mode of transportation in electric vehicles. Advances in technology and ongoing research are continually improving the efficiency, range, and overall performance of electric vehicles.

            <section id="cost">
                <h2>Average Cost Per Kilometer</h2>
                <p>The cost per kilometer for an electric vehicle (EV) can vary based on several factors, including the specific model of the EV, the cost of electricity,
                     and the efficiency of the vehicle. Here's a general approach to calculating the cost per kilometer for an electric vehicle:

                    <div id="heading">Formula for Cost per Kilometer:</div>
                    Cost per Kilometer=(Cost per kWh/Electric Vehicle Efficiency)<br>
                    
                    Where:<br>
                    
                    Cost per Kilometer: The total cost of driving one kilometer in the electric vehicle.<br>
                    Cost per kWh: The cost of electricity per kilowatt-hour.<br>
                    Electric Vehicle Efficiency: The efficiency of the electric vehicle, measured in kilowatt-hours per kilometer (kWh/km) or miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh).<br>

                    <div id="heading">Steps to Calculate:</div>

                    1. Determine the Cost per Kilowatt-Hour (kWh):
                    Check your electricity bill to find the cost per kWh. This is the rate you are charged for each unit of electricity consumed.<br>

                    2. Find the Efficiency of the Electric Vehicle:
                    Refer to the vehicle specifications or manual to determine the efficiency of your specific electric vehicle. Efficiency is often provided in kWh/km or mi/kWh.<br>
                    
                    
                    Average cost per km in India ranges from 0.8 Rupees to 1.2 Rupees<br>
                    
                    <div id="heading">Considerations:</div>
                    Charging Efficiency: Charging efficiency may vary, and it's essential to consider losses during the charging process. The electric vehicle's efficiency rating often considers these losses.<br>
                    
                    Battery Degradation: Over time, the efficiency of the electric vehicle may be impacted by battery degradation. This can affect the cost per kilometer in the long term.<br>
                    
                    Varied Electricity Rates: If electricity rates vary during different times of the day (peak vs. off-peak rates), consider these variations when calculating the cost per kilometer.<br>
